# Development Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local for local development

# GitHub Personal Access Token (optional, for development only)
# Helps avoid rate limiting during development (60 requests/hour without token, 5000 with token)
# To create a token:
# 1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
# 2. Click "Generate new token" â†’ "Generate new token (classic)"
# 3. Give it a name like "qsafe-dev"
# 4. No scopes needed for public repo access (just leave all unchecked)
# 5. Copy the token and paste it below
#
# IMPORTANT: This token is ONLY used in development mode (when import.meta.env.DEV is true)
# It will NOT be included in production builds
# Never commit your actual .env.local file to git
#
# Uncomment and add your token:
# VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# GitLab Personal Access Token (future enhancement)
# VITE_GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Cache duration in milliseconds (default: 300000 = 5 minutes)
# VITE_ACTIVITY_CACHE_DURATION=300000
