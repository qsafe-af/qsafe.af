# Loading State Improvements for BlockDetail Component

## Problem Statement

When the BlockDetail component first loads or is refreshed, users would briefly see misleading error messages:
1. "WebSocket connection failed" - shown while connection is establishing
2. "Block not found" - shown while block data is being fetched

These errors would flash for less than a second before disappearing once the data loaded successfully, creating a poor user experience and causing unnecessary concern.

## Solution

Implemented a proper loading state management system that shows a spinner during initial load instead of premature error messages.

### Key Changes

#### 1. Initial Load State Tracking
Added `isInitialLoad` state to track whether this is the first connection attempt:
```typescript
const [isInitialLoad, setIsInitialLoad] = useState(true);
```

#### 2. Conditional Error Display
Errors are now only shown after the initial load phase completes:
```typescript
if (!isInitialLoad) {
  setBlockData(prev => ({ 
    ...prev, 
    loading: false, 
    error: errorMessage 
  }));
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced Loading UI
The loading state now shows:
- Bootstrap spinner animation
- Current operation status ("Connecting..." or "Fetching block data...")
- Block identifier being loaded

```typescript
<div className="text-center py-5">
  <Spinner animation="border" variant="primary" />
  <div className="mt-3">
    <h6>Loading block {blockNumberOrHash}</h6>
    <p className="text-muted small mb-0">
      {connectionStatus === "connecting" 
        ? "Connecting to blockchain node..." 
        : "Fetching block data..."}
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### 4. State Transitions

The component now follows these state transitions:

**Initial Load:**
```
1. Component mounts → isInitialLoad = true, loading = true
2. WebSocket connects → Show "Connecting..." message
3. Data queries sent → Show "Fetching block data..." message
4. Data received → isInitialLoad = false, loading = false, show data
5. Error occurs → Only show if isInitialLoad = false
```

**Retry Flow:**
```
1. User clicks retry → isInitialLoad = true, loading = true
2. Connection reestablished → Follow initial load flow
```

### Error Handling Strategy

Errors are now categorized and handled differently:

1. **Connection Errors During Initial Load**: Suppressed until all retry attempts exhausted
2. **Data Errors During Initial Load**: Suppressed to avoid flash messages
3. **Errors After Initial Load**: Displayed immediately with context
4. **Validation Errors**: Only shown after successful connection

### Benefits

1. **No Flash of Errors**: Users don't see temporary error messages during normal loading
2. **Clear Loading State**: Users know the page is working on their request
3. **Progressive Feedback**: Loading message updates as operation progresses
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Real errors are still shown when appropriate

## Testing the Improvements

To verify the improvements work correctly:

1. **Fresh Page Load**
   - Navigate to `/chains/resonance/block/115241`
   - Should see spinner without any error flash
   - Block details appear once loaded

2. **Page Refresh**
   - Press F5 on block detail page
   - Should see spinner, not errors
   - Previous content replaced smoothly

3. **Slow Connection**
   - Throttle network in DevTools
   - Loading spinner should persist longer
   - No premature error messages

4. **Actual Errors**
   - Try invalid block number like `999999999`
   - Error should appear after connection established
   - Retry button should work properly

## Implementation Details

### State Management
- `isInitialLoad`: Tracks first connection attempt
- `connectionStatus`: WebSocket connection state
- `blockData.loading`: Data fetching state
- `retryCount`: Number of retry attempts

### Display Logic
```typescript
{blockData.loading || (isInitialLoad && !blockData.blockNumber) ? (
  // Show loading spinner
) : blockData.error ? (
  // Show error with retry option
) : (
  // Show block details
)}
```

### Reset Points
The `isInitialLoad` flag is reset:
- On successful data load
- When user clicks retry
- When WebSocket reconnects
- When component remounts

## Future Enhancements

1. **Skeleton Loading**: Show block detail structure with placeholder content
2. **Progressive Loading**: Display partial data as it arrives
3. **Connection State Indicator**: Persistent indicator of WebSocket health
4. **Timeout Handling**: Show error if loading takes too long
5. **Offline Detection**: Special message when user is offline
